# Touch hold directive

The `v-touch-hold` directive calls a function when the user touches an element and holds it without moving.

<PageFeatures />

## Usage

On a touch device, touch and hold a file to start selecting. Once a hold fires, the tap that would follow it is cancelled, and the browser's own long-press behavior (text selection, the iOS link callout and the Android context menu) is suppressed for the element.

<ExamplesExample file="v-touch-hold/usage" />

::: info

`v-touch-hold` only reacts to touch. For mouse and keyboard users, pair it with a `@contextmenu` listener or use the **context-menu** prop of [v-menu](/components/menus/#open-on-right-click), which handles both.
